Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Techniques I used: Sliding Window

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy = 0;
        int sell = 1;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        while(sell<prices.length){
            if(prices[sell] < prices[buy]){
                buy++;
            }
            else{
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit,prices[sell] - prices[buy]);
                sell++;
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
